// 		The rule about pointers vs. values for receivers is that value methods can be invoked on pointers and values,
//		but pointer methods can only be invoked on pointers.

// json.Marshaler interface. T his should return the JSON-encoded value for the movie
// runtime (in our case, it will return a string in the format "<runtime> mins").

	// needs to surrounded by double quotes in order to be
